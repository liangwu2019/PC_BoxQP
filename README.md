# Code for "A Time-certified Predictor-corrector IPM Algorithm for Box-QP".
This paper proposes a novel predictor-corrector IPM algorithm with a certified worst-case iteration bound and low practical iteration behavior. It will be useful in real-time MPC applications, as both the worst-case and average execution times are critical. 
## Practical and theoretical behavior on random Box-QPs
